# SkyDataViewer

A tool to view/modify/export fish-eye sky photos with corresponding multispectral radiance measurements.

### Prerequisites

The software developed in Python on a Windows box and intended to be cross-platform.
Python modules required (version used):
Python    (3.5.2)
PyQt5     (5.11.2)
pandas    (0.21.0)
numpy     (1.14.2)
pyqtgraph (0.10.0)
Pillow    (5.2.0)

### Instructions

Run the application.
Select a data directory (which must have data organized in a specific way).
Use the combobox dropdowns and sliders to select the capture date and exposure desired.
Click and drag to select sampling pattern coordinates.
View corresponding radiance measurements below.

Right-click (mouse-secondary) on canvas for more selection and HUD options.

To export, first run Setup Export File to specify parameters. Exports after that will be appended to the same file.

### Controls

mouse-wheel            moves the capture time slider
mouse-primary-drag     selects sampling pattern coordinates
mouse-secondary        context menu
mouse-wheel-click-hold rotates sky photo
ctrl+selection         adds to currently selected samples
shift+selection        removes from currently selected samples
ctrl+A                 selects all samples
ctrl+I                 selects inverse

### Notes

Data directory must be organized in a very specific way.
See https://spectralskylight.github.io/RadianceEstimationData for example data

Context menu -> Graph Resolution applies to plotting of spectral radiance. 1 = every nanometer, 2 = every other, etc. Adjusting this can significantly improve performance of plotting.

Pixel Region / Weighting - Refers to the pixel kernel used determine the final pixel color during export. The color can be seen in the bottom-right of the canvas.

res/settings.json - Is created on execution and contains default and saved settings as you use the application, which can be edited by hand. There is a menu option in Help which can be toggled to prevent overwriting of settings.

res/dsetfix.py - Is a script for searching/operating on exported datasets.
res/ddirfix.py - Is a script for cleaning/organizing a data directory with corresponding sky photos and radiance measurements.
